 🚗🔧 Design and Analysis of a Catalytic Converter

> *Reimagining emission control for the next generation of motorcycles.*

## 📖 Overview

Catalytic converters are silent heroes fighting air pollution — but they come with challenges: high cost, backpressure issues, and inefficiencies.  
This project **redefines** a catalytic converter for a **Hero Single Cylinder 99.7cc engine**, focusing on:

- Smarter **geometry**.
- Optimized **internal flow**.
- Cost-effective **material choices** (avoiding expensive noble metals).

Through **advanced CAD modeling** and **CFD simulation**, we engineered a solution that **reduces pressure drop**, **enhances flow uniformity**, and **maximizes catalytic efficiency**.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- 🛠 **Design** an innovative catalytic converter geometry for small engine motorcycles.
- 🌬 **Optimize** exhaust flow with minimal backpressure.
- ⚙️ **Compare** the performance of **square vs hexagonal** honeycomb structures.
- 🔬 **Simulate** real-world conditions using **ANSYS Discovery**.
